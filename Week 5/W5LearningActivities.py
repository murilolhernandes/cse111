# To validate user input means to check user input to ensure it is in the correct format before using that input. The
# program in example 12 validates user input by handling exceptions. Notice in the get_float function, there is a try
# block at line 574. The try block is part of a loop that validates user input in the get_float function. Notice at line 588
# that the except block handles ValueError which is the type of exception that the float function raises when it
# tries to convert text to a number but the text contains characters that are not numeric.
